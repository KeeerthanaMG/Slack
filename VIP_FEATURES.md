# VIP User Management System

## Overview

The VIP User Management System is a comprehensive extension to the Slack bot that enables **personal VIP tracking lists** for each user. Since Slack's native VIP data is not accessible via API, this system allows individuals to create and manage their own VIP lists for specialized tracking and summarization of important contacts' communications across both private DMs and public channels.

**üéØ Key Feature:** Each user maintains their own personal VIP list, allowing personalized tracking of important contacts without interfering with others' VIP preferences.
